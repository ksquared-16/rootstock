# Code Assessment - Initial

In this folder you will find code for a project that is
incomplete, missing features, containing bugs,
or a combination of the above.

## Task

Your task is to identify + implement to attain the
correct behaviour in this project.

Specifically:

### `code-01`

Private smart contract verification.

Within your local git repository,
create a new directory `07-verify-smart-contract/code-01`.
From this code assessment, copy
`code-01/commands-and-outputs.md`
into this new directory as
`07-verify-smart-contract/code-01/commands-and-outputs.md`.

In the previous module,
"Module 6: Deploy Smart Contracts",
a smart contract `RskDevCourseExample06Code01V1` was deployed,
but has not yet been verified.
Now verify this locally.

(1)
Compile the smart contract and obtain its bytecode.

(2)
Find the deployment transaction of the deployed smart contract,
and obtain its bytcode.

### `code-02`

Verification with RSK Testnet Explorer.

Within your local git repository,
create a new directory `07-verify-smart-contract/code-01`.
From this code assessment, copy
`code-02/commands-and-outputs.md`
into this new directory as
`07-verify-smart-contract/code-02/commands-and-outputs.md`.

In the previous module,
"Module 6: Deploy Smart Contracts",
several smart contracts have been deployed but not yet verified.
Now verify them on the RSK Testnet Explorer.

Now edit `commands-and-outputs.md`
and make the following changes.

(1)
There should be multiple smart contracts verified,
so for **each** of these smart contracts
replace `YOUR_ANSWER` with the name of the smart contract
followed by the URL of the code tab for it on the RSK Testnet Explorer.

(2)
When you are verifying the `OneMilNftPixels` smart contract,
take a screenshot of the form *after* filling it out,
and *before* submitting it, and save it as
`06-deploy-smart-contract/code-02/screenshot-explorer-form.png`.

(3)
Navigate to the RSK Testnet Explorer for `OneMilNftPixels`,
and then to its "Code" tab.
Take a screenshot of this, and save it as
`06-deploy-smart-contract/code-02/screenshot-explorer.png`.

## Submissions

Before you submit, check that your code functions
and meets the criteria set out above.
Once you are satisfied, refer to the
code assessment submission instructions document
available in "Module 1: Course Introduction".
